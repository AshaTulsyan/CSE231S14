We present here an implementation of a data flow analysis module for the C++ LLVM compiler. Our implementation includes four types of analyses 1) Pointer Analysis 2) Constant Propagation 3) Available Expressions 4) Range analysis. All analyses are made on a function scope. We first present our interface followed by detailed description of the implementation of each analysis.
