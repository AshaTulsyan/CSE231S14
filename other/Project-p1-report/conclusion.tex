The project was completed succesfully . Learning outcomes were a working understanding of LLVM optimiser passes. We are capable of transforming and instrumenting code. We have developed an efficient method to develop, test and debug the LLVM source tree with a debug api and symbol indexed code base via the eclipse CDT. Understanding how to instrument code has provided a powerful tool for analysis of any optimisation heuristics applied by other opt passes. Instrumentation will allow us to both formulate and test heuristics based on the performance of compiled code.\\
To conclude, this project has provided us with a solid foundation for the second upcoming project for CSE 231
